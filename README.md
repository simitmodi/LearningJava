## 📋 About

This repository reflects my journey in learning Java programming. It consists of **individual `.java` files** (no folders, just programs), each tackling a unique concept, logic puzzle, or classic problem—from bitwise operations and matrix multiplication to palindrome checking and array manipulation.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Requirements:**
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Any code editor or Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)
- Git (optional, for cloning)

**How to Use:**
git clone https://github.com/simitmodi/LearningJava.git
cd LearningJava/src
javac FileName.java
java FileName
Replace `FileName.java` with the name of any program you want to run.

## 📁 Program List Highlights

Every file in `/src` is a single, ready-to-run Java program. Here are some sample programs you’ll find:

- **AddTwoNumbers.java** – Simple addition program
- **AgeCategorizer.java** – Categorizes ages into groups
- **ArmstrongNumber.java** – Checks if a number is Armstrong
- **BitwiseANDOperator.java**, etc. – Bitwise operations
- **FactorialCalculation.java** – Calculates factorial
- **FibonacciSeries.java** – Generates Fibonacci numbers
- **LargestNumberChecker.java** – Finds the largest among given numbers
- **MatrixAddition.java** – Adds two matrices
- **PalindromeChecker.java** – Checks if a string or number is a palindrome
- **PrimeNumberChecker.java** – Checks for primality
- **ReverseArray.java**, **ReverseDigits.java** – Array and digit operations
- **SumOfDigits.java**, **SumOddDigits.java**, etc.
- ...and many more!
- (See full list by browsing the `/src` folder)

> Each file is named to reflect its primary function, so it’s easy to find related code.
